This document is for the planned goals of the project at hand. 


Current goals:
	
	Work on variables input system:
		This means making the base, then legacy and new variants.
		Work on checks for existing variables, existing stats and keywords
		complete now work on the calculations end 
	work on Calculations:
		Start off with calculation inputs, then calculation base.
		
			Test the variables, then work on a pass through function for the calculations. (nearly done, just work on non-legacy first)
			After completing the inputs system, then work on the system that puts it all together
		This means making a means to grab the values first, then worry about how to input the information in.
		
		
		Now to finish the project which is to work on calculations system to read the lines and make use of them.
