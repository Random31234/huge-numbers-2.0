This text document is to contain all the documentation that will be used, which will be contained in a string each by topic

#Do note, that /n is necessary for determining the end of line..
Topics: //n
	Keywords: This topic goes over documented keywords, and what they mean for this program in the context of the mathematics
	system. Finally one more thing, no variables or stats can be named as any of the keywords or symbols
	//n
	Errors: This topic goes over commonly made errors done and what can be done to resolve them
	//n
	Limitations: This topic goes over limits that are in place, as the program does have flaws in what it cannot do or 
	are in place to protect users from themselves. 
	//n 
	recommendations: This topic will go over what is recommended to be done with the mathematics system
	
	//n
	Settings: This topic goes over the various settings. 
	

Keywords://n
	
	All keywords must be seperated from variables or stats with 1 space do not use more than 1 space
	//n
	If making a new line, make sure to add a space before and after so the program can properly read the terms
	//n
	Do NOT put in the <> symbols where you put the name of the value in question 
	//n
	input: This refers to what is inputted value into the calculation, this variable is a temporary variable that will often be changed
	//n
	tempvar<num>: This keyword represents one of 5 temporary variables that are kept between mathematics, and is used to keep track of variiables that are not kept in stats or more permanent variables it is 1-5
	//n
	execute <mathname> <Value>: This keyword is used to call upon other calculations with the name designated and named, if the value is not an existing value, it will default to 0 and will be referred to in the math that is called upon as the input
	//n
	print <value>: This keyword is used to print the value into the text box accordingly
	//n
	end: This keyword is used to terminate the calculation before reaching the end.
	//n
	<value1> + <value2> :This symbol represents addition between two values
	//n
	<value1> - <value2> :This symbol represents subtraction between two values
	//n
	<value1> * <value2>:This symbol represents multiplication between two values
	//n
	<value1> / <value2>:This symbol represents division between two values where value 1 is divided by value 2
	//n
	<value1> ^ <value2>: This symbol represents value 1 being brought to a power of value 2. 
	//n
	<value1> âˆš <value2>: This symbol represents value being rooted by value 2, yes it is contrary to actual square roots, but it is done this way for simplicity
	//n
	<value1> ~ <value2>: This symbol calls on a random value between two variables, it is not true random for massively different numbers, but for smaller ones will work almost as usual
	//n
	<value1> = <value2>: This symbol represents value 2 being set equal to value 1
	//n
	These from here are comparator symbols, these symbols require a { and } and within these symbols will be what is excluded if the comparator comes up false, make sure to give a space before and after these symbols.
	//n
	<value1> >= <value2>: If value 1 is greater than or equal to value 2, it returns true and does the function contained in the symbols
	//n
	<value1> <= <value2>: If value 1 is less than or equal to value 2, it returns true and does the function contained in the symbols
	//n
	<value1> == <value2>: If value 1 is equal to value 2, it returns true and does the function contained in the symbols
	//n
	<value1> > <value2>: If value 1 is greater than value 2, it returns true and does the function contained in the symbols
	//n
	<value1> < <value2>: If value 1 is less than value 2, it returns true and does the function contained in the symbols
