This text document is to contain all the documentation that will be used, which will be contained in a string each by topic

#Do note, that /n is necessary for determining the end of line..
Topics: //n
	Keywords: This topic goes over documented keywords, and what they mean for this program in the context of the mathematics
	system. Finally one more thing, no variables or stats can be named as any of the keywords or symbols
	//n
	Errors: This topic goes over commonly made errors done and what can be done to resolve them
	//n
	Limitations: This topic goes over limits that are in place, as the program does have flaws in what it cannot do or 
	are in place to protect users from themselves. 
	//n 
	recommendations: This topic will go over what is recommended to be done with the mathematics system
	
	//n
	Settings: This topic goes over the various settings. 
	

Keywords://n
	
	All keywords must be seperated from variables or stats with 1 space do not use more than 1 space
	//n
	If making a new line, make sure to add a space before and after so the program can properly read the terms
	//n
	input: This refers to what is inputted into the calculation, this variable is a temporary variable that will often be changed
	//n
	tempvar<num>: This keyword represents one of 5 temporary variables that are kept between mathematics, and is used to keep track of variiables that are not kept in stats or more permanent variables it is 1-5
	//n
	execute <mathname> <inputtedValue>: This keyword is used to call upon other calculations with the name designated and named, if the inputted value is not an existing value, it will default to 0
	//n
	+:This symbol represents addition between two variables
	//n
	-:This symbol represents subtraction between two variables
	//n
	*:This symbol represents multiplication
	//n
	^:This symbol represents being raised to a power. its handled much like normal order of operations
	//n
	~: This symbol calls on a random value between two variables, it is not true random, but close enough for small numbers
	//n
	//n
	//n
	//n
	=: This symbol represents the variable or stat being set equal to an outcome
	//n
